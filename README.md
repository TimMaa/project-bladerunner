# Life of Game (or something else that resembles much writes and reads)

Did you ever feel lost in life?
Did you ever think noone liked you?
Did you ever need a database that could read and write super fast?

This great project is your answer! 
It is the frontend for a **Cassandra Use-Case**, which is supposed to be a game where users collaborate (or fight) in drawing images on a canvas.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
It's also great for just showing it temporarily.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. 
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

We don't need to test.

## Running end-to-end tests

And especially not E2E
